## 📝 Description

I started this project to improve my Laravel skills. My goal is to explore all parts of the framework, touch on every aspect of Laravel, 
and become a better developer by learning from my mistakes along the way.

In this project I try to implement as many best practices as possible, focusing on clean code, separation of concerns, and maintainability. 
As a junior developer I still have a lot to learn, and this project is a great way for me to grow and challenge myself in a practical way.
